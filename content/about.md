## Education

**RCCIIT** — *Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering*  
Kolkata, WB | 2021 – 2025  

---

I am Abhishek Kumar Azad, a proactive and results-driven software developer specializing in Android development and full-stack engineering. Currently pursuing my Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science & Engineering at RCCIIT, I have honed a diverse technical skill set spanning Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript, and backend technologies.

My journey as a developer began with a curiosity for how software powers everyday devices and evolved into building complex, modular applications that solve real-world problems. From creating cutting-edge Android apps using Jetpack Compose and Material3 to developing scalable backend services with Node.js, FastAPI, and Docker, I embrace challenges with a growth mindset.

I excel at designing intuitive user experiences, optimizing performance through profiling and concurrency, and integrating APIs to build feature-rich applications. My projects reflect a strong commitment to code quality, maintainability, and user-centric design—backed by rigorous testing and modern architectural patterns.

With hands-on experience in compiler design, AI-powered chatbots, and blockchain platforms, I bring innovative solutions to both educational and enterprise contexts. I am passionate about continuous learning, collaboration, and contributing to open-source communities.

I am excited to leverage my skills and creativity to drive impactful software products, contribute to visionary teams, and grow as a developer who shapes the future of technology.
