Not all granolas are equal. When picking a product, consider:

Some brands also offer **fortified granolas** with probiotics, superfoods (e.g., spirulina, maca), or adaptogens.

- **Add fresh fruits** to reduce the need for extra sweeteners.
- **Combine with Greek yogurt** for a high-protein, gut-friendly meal.
- **Store properly** to maintain crunch — keep airtight in a cool place.
