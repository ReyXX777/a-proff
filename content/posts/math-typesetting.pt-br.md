A loneliness epidemic in the U.S. is taking a toll on people's physical and mental health. Mental health problems linked to loneliness include higher rates of anxiety, depression, suicide, anger, and violence. Loneliness also impacts physical health, contributing to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, infection, diabetes, dementia, and early death.

One effective way to cope with loneliness is to strengthen your existing relationships and reconnect with friends and family who may have drifted apart.

## What is loneliness?

Loneliness is a feeling that you are not connected to other people or that you don't belong. Lonely people feel as if they don't have anyone they can confide in or do things with. It's possible to be surrounded by people and still feel lonely.

There are many factors that can contribute to feeling lonely. Friends or family members may no longer live nearby. Participation in volunteer or religious groups is declining. Online shopping makes it easy to rarely leave the house, reducing opportunities to meet new people or run into friends and acquaintances. Social media sometimes causes people to compare their lives with others, and may create feelings of coming up short or missing out.

For some people, having a chronic illness, losing a spouse, having a low income, or recently moving to a new home or job can contribute to loneliness. The COVID-19 pandemic was a major factor in fueling the loneliness epidemic.

Research shows that about one-third of all Americans report feeling lonely. If you are among them, strengthening the relationships you already have can help you cope with loneliness.

## Combat loneliness by nurturing existing relationships

You may think the best way to deal with loneliness is to make new friends â€” and that can certainly be helpful. But be sure to also consider the relationships you already have. You have a head start when you can draw on a wealth of shared memories and experiences.

Relationships take effort. If they aren't nurtured, they can wither and fade. A strong first step towards conquering loneliness is to think about how you can improve existing relationships in your life.

## Tips for building deeper connections with family and friends

Build deeper connections with family and friends by demonstrating that you care about them. Here are some simple ways to do that:

- Set up regular times to get together.  
- Tell them how much they mean to you; don't assume they already know it.  
- Try to listen as much as you speak.  
- Minimize distractions when you're with them, such as frequently checking your phone.  
- Ask questions about their lives and activities.  

## Reconnecting with loved ones who've drifted apart

Another way to cope with loneliness is to reach out to a friend with whom you've lost contact.

If you don't have their phone number, you can usually find them through an online search. They likely will be happy to reconnect with you. Recalling good times and fond memories can give both of you a lift.

## Advice for maintaining relationships over time and distance

Physical distance doesn't have to be a barrier. If you can't meet in person, communicate in other ways and, if needed, schedule time to connect. For example:

- Plan a regular weekly or monthly time when you can connect on the phone or with a video call.  
- Send letters to each other each month.  
- Send a good-morning text each day, or a good-night text each evening.  
- Create a cooking club where you and a friend prepare the same meal and share tips and recipes.  
- Read the same book or watch the same movie, and then discuss it over the phone.  

It takes effort to nurture relationships, but it can be one of the easiest and most rewarding ways to combat loneliness.
