**Build Your Own Resilience Plan**  
*Three strategies to help you move forward when you're stressed, burned out, anxious, or sad*

Nantucket — a 14-mile-long island off Massachusetts — has a 40-point resiliency plan to withstand the effects of climate change. Similarly, individuals can benefit from building personal resilience plans to deal with life's challenges, big and small. But what exactly is resilience, and how can we cultivate it?

### What is resilience?

Resilience is the ability to adapt to adversity and move forward despite setbacks.  
"It's a flexible mindset that helps you adapt, think critically, and stay focused on your values and what matters most," says Dr. Luana Marques, associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

While everyone has the capacity for resilience, chronic stress — like financial struggles or an unfulfilling job — can wear it down. The good news: resilience can be strengthened with consistent practice.

### 1. Shift your thoughts

When stressed, your brain may go straight to negative assumptions. Instead, broaden your perspective.

> “If your brain says, ‘I’ll never get that raise,’ slow the emotional response by thinking about why you *do* deserve it,” says Dr. Marques. “That shifts your mindset from anxious to action-oriented.”

### 2. Approach what you want

Avoidance reinforces fear and keeps you stuck. Instead, take a step toward your goals — even if it feels uncomfortable.

> Example: Afraid of public speaking? Build a PowerPoint and practice with friends.  
> In conflict at home? Don’t avoid — schedule time to talk about it calmly.

---

### 3. Align actions with values

Stress often arises when your actions clash with your core values.

> “If you value family but always miss dinner, or value health but drink excessively, misalignment creates tension,” Marques explains.

Identify your top three values and reflect: Are your daily actions in sync with them? Make adjustments as needed.

### Tips for success

Dr. Marques recommends reviewing your weekly calendar to ensure it reflects your values. Adjust as needed to stay on track.

Support your mental resilience with a healthy lifestyle:
- Sleep 7–9 hours per night
- Follow a balanced, Mediterranean-style diet
- Get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, plus strength training twice a week
- Limit alcohol (≤1 drink/day for women, ≤2 for men)
- Don’t smoke
- Stay socially connected — in person, online, or by text

### Need help building resilience?

Even elite athletes have coaches. If needed, seek support from:
- Online courses (e.g., from Dr. Marques)
- Licensed therapists — ideally with expertise in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

Practicing resilience now helps you prepare for tougher times ahead. Like Nantucket weathering storms, you’ll be more ready when dark clouds roll in.
